# A bit about me

Hi my name is Freddie. I am someone who likes to tinker with things and figure out how things works mostly through breaking them. 

I am a budding geneticist with an intrest in bioinformatics.
This website/blog will be my place to chronicle these projects and some of the things Iâ€™ve been working on in my free time.

I have 2 years practical experience as a medical laboratory technician, performing a range of techniques such as seqeuencing, fragment analysis and RT-qPCR. I also perform basic anlysis of data gained from these assays. I am resposible for many services and soley responsible for running 3 services (BRAF fussion testing, Import of data in BlueFuse data and Sanger sequencing).
