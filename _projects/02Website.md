I had always wanted to create my own website and so while self-isolating, I decided to use my 10 days of isolation to make a website. 

I used the static site generator Jekyll to build the basic structure of the website. After burshing up on my HTML and CSS knowledge I then designed and created the present site. The site itself is hosted on Github pages.

This is the first version of this site and I hope continue building on it.
