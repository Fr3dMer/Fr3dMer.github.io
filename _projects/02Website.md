I had always wanted to create my own website/blog to document my projects. Then Covid-19 happened and I had to isolate after a positive contact, giving me 10 days to make a website from scratch. 


I used the static site generator Jekyll to build the basic structure of the website, as it provided a quick and easy way too get it running. Its compatibility with Github pages was also a massive plus, as it would allow for free hosting. To create a usable layout I brushed up on my CSS and HTML and began creating the layout and styles for the pages. The great thing about using Jekyll + Github pages is that the second I finished this, I could push this to a Github repository and use Github pages to host my site. 

This is the first version of this site and I hope continue building on it.
