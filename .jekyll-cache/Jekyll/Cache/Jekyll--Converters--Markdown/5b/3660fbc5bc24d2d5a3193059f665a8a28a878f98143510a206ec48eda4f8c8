<p>I have always struggled getting up in winter, with the dark and cold morning making it imposible to get out of bed. To fix this I decided to buy something like a Philips Wake-Up Light Alarm Clock, however seeing a price of over Â£100 decided I could make something beter at half that cost.</p>

<p>For the light source I used an IKEA TrÃ¥dfri lightbulb paired with a TrÃ¥dfri gateway. I then used a  a Rasberry Pi 3b to send commands to the gateway via CoAP(Constrained Application Protocol) using the library libcoap (https://github.com/obgm/libcoap)</p>
