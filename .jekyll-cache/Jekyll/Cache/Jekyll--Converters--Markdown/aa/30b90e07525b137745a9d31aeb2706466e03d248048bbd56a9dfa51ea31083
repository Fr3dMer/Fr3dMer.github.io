I"œ<p>I find it impossible to wake up early in winter, especially when its dark. After finally getting sick of this and having some free time I set out to make a Sunrise-Simulator. The idea was to simply write a python script which could communicate with a wireless light bulb and have it gradually brighten while changing hue. After getting inspiration from this blog post by <a href="https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/controlling-ikea-tradfri-lights-from-your-pi">Sandy Macdonald</a> I went out and bought an IKEA Tr√•dfri gateway and light bulb.</p>

<p>The plan was to send commands to the Tr√•dfri gateway via its DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) API end point over CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol). I used the library <a href="https://github.com/obgm/libcoap">libcoap</a> to send commands to the gateway over CoAP and after verifying this works, wrote a simple python script which would send commands to the gateway to gradually change the hue and brightness of a light bulb. After some trial and error I got a ‚Äúsunrise‚Äù I was happy with.</p>

<p>Next I wanted to find some way to set the time for when the sunrise would start. At first I added a small function to the sunrise script that would read a text file when it starts up and if the string in the text file == .currentTime() the sunrise method would begin.</p>

<p>Happy with this result I installed the library <a href="https://github.com/obgm/libcoap">libcoap</a> on a old Raspberry Pi 3b+ and using SCP transferred the script over.</p>

<p>This worked well for a while, however whenever I needed to change the time that the sunrise would happen I would have to SSH into the RPI to change the text file. I wanted to make this easier for myself. So I bought a touchscreen and set out to make a GUI I could use to see, change and toggle the simulator on/off. I did this through the python plug in <a href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQT5</a>. Using this I created a multi threaded GUI that could now act as the front end for displaying the time, to allow the user to set the simulated sunrise time and toggle the simulator on/off.</p>

<p>My next goal will be to install apache2 so that I can set these details via an app on my phone.</p>
