<p>Hi my name is Freddie. I am someone who likes to tinker with things and figure out how things works mostly through breaking them.</p>

<p>I am a budding geneticist with an intrest in bioinformatics.
This website/blog will be my place to chronicle these projects and some of the things Iâ€™ve been working on in my free time.</p>
