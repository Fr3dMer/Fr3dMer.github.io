<p>Iâ€™ve been playing around with Conwayâ€™s Game of Life and trying to make it run on larger and larger grids, while trying to keep each tick at 0.5s.</p>

<p>Right now Iâ€™m at a 60x60 grid using CPython. Iâ€™ve learnâ€™t alot since writing this code so my next plan is to go through and re-write the inefficient bits while using a different interpreter.</p>

<p>After looking at flat prices I had a hunch they may follow a positve curve throughout their lifetimes with a dip around the 5 year mark.</p>

<p>I analysed price data from HM Land Registryâ€™s dataset for all transactions since 1995 by writing a python script to filter out all non-flat transactions in my area and then ordering the data by postcode and creating an index. I also created a list of unique addresses for the area. By combining both of these lists I could find the transaction history for each flat. After creating this final dataset I could manipulate it to find that there is indeed a positve curve with a dip.</p>

<p>My next goal is to use R to graph this data and output some nice illustrations of it.</p>
