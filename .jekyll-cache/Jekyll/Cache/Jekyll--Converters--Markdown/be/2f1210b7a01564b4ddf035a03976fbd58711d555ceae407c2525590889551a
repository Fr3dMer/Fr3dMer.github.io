I"Ô<p>I always wanted to create my own website and so while self-isolating, I decided to use my 10 days of isolation productivley to make my own website.</p>

<p>I used the static site generator Jekyll to build the basic structure of the website. After burshing up on my HTML and CSS knowledge I then designed and created the present site. The site itself is hosted on Github pages.</p>

<p>This is the first version of this site and I will continue building on it.</p>
