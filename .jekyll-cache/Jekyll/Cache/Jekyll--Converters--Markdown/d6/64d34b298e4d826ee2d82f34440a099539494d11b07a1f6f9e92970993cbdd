I"-<p>I find it impossible to wake up early in winter, especially when its dark. After finally getting sick of this and having some free time I set out to make a Sunrise-Simulator. The idea was to simply write a python script which could commuicate with a wireless lightbulb and have it gradually brighten while changing hue. After getting sinspiration from this blog post by <a href="https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/controlling-ikea-tradfri-lights-from-your-pi">Sandy Macdonald</a> I went out and bought an IKEA Tr√•dfri gateway and lightbulb.</p>
