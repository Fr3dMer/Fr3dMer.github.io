I"Õ<p>Hi my name is Freddie. I like to tinker with things and figure out how they work mostly through breaking them.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a budding geneticist with an intrest in bioinformatics and the application of algorithms in the analysis of large datasets. I have a degree in Medical Genetics and work in a NHS Genomics Laboratory Hub.</p>

<p>This website/blog will be my place to showcase these projects and some of the things Iâ€™ve been working on in my free time.</p>
