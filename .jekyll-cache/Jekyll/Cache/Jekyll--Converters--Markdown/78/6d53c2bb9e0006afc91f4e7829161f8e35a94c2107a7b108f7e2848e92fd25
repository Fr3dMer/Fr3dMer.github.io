<p>I’ve been playing around with Conway’s Game of Life and trying to make it run on larger and larger grids, while trying to keep each tick at 0.5s.</p>

<p>Right now I’m at a 60x60 grid using CPython. I’ve learn’t alot since writing this code so my next plan is to go through and re-write the inefficient bits while uising a different interpreter.</p>

<p>After looking at flat prices I had a hunch they may follow a positve curve throughout their lifetimes with a dip around the 5 year mark.</p>

<p>I analysed price data from HM Land Registry’s dataset for all transactions since 1995 by writing a python script to filter out all non-flat transactions in my area and then creating a ordered list of transactions based on postcode. I then created a list of unique addresses, which was then used to find all the transactions for each adress. After creating this final dataset I could manipulate it to find that there is indeed a positve curve with a dip.</p>

<p>My next goal is to use R to graph this data and output some nice illustrations of it.</p>

<p>On my home PC I use Windows and Arch linux (with GNOME as my desktop environment) on seperate SSD’s, using rEFInd as boot menu to choose between operating systems.</p>
