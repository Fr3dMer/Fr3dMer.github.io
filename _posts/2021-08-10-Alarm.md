Place holder until I actually write the article.








I have always struggled getting up in winter, with the dark and cold morning making it imposible to get out of bed. To fix this I decided to buy something like a Philips Wake-Up Light Alarm Clock, however seeing a price of over £100 decided I could make something beter at half that cost. 

For the light source I used an IKEA Trådfri lightbulb paired with a Trådfri gateway. I then used a  a Rasberry Pi 3b to send commands to the gateway via CoAP(Constrained Application Protocol) using the library libcoap (https://github.com/obgm/libcoap)
